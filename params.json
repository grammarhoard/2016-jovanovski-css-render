By giving it a viewport size, it renders your page and checks to see what \r\nelements are primarily visible in that viewport. It then extracts all CSS rules that apply to these \"critical\" elements, and embeds\r\nthem in a `<style>` tag in the `<head>` tag, loading the rest of the CSS from the bottom of the `<body>` tag with Javascript.\r\n\r\nThis allows the browser to start rendering the page much faster, because CSS is a render-blocking resource, meaning, while the browser\r\nis downloading all the CSS files defined in the head of the page, it will display a blank page, and only start rendering once it has them all\r\ndownloaded.\r\n \r\nCSS Focusr helps solve this by inlining critical CSS in the head of the page (saving GET requests), and moving the rest\r\nto the bottom of the body, where they have no more elements to block, and can be applied without stopping the render process.\r\n\r\n###A more technical description\r\nCSS Focusr looks for `<link rel='stylesheet'>` tags, extracts the CSS from the linked files,\r\nlooks for critical CSS by rendering the input HTML file/URL, and checking if any element defined by the selectors in the parsed CSS\r\nare positioned within the defined viewport. All critical CSS is then inlined as a `<style>` tag in the `<head>` tag, and the rest\r\nis added into a Javascript function at the end of the `<body>` tag that uses the browser animation queue to load them in asynchronously.\r\n\r\n##Usage\r\nEach HTML file/URL that needs to be processed should be defined in its own group. Do this via `config.json` file, where you also override the default options of the tool.\r\n### Example\r\nThis is the full default configuration file, with all possible settings that can be overridden.\r\n```\r\n{\r\n    \"allowJS\": false,\r\n    \"debug\": false,\r\n    \"processExternalCss\": true,\r\n    \"renderTimeout\": 60000,\r\n    \"groups\": [\r\n        {\r\n        \"enabled\": true,\r\n        \"baseDir\": \"tests/\",\r\n        \"inputFile\": \"\",\r\n        \"outputFile\": \"\",\r\n        \"alwaysInclude\": [],\r\n        \"httpAuth\": \"\",\r\n        \"wordpress\": false,\r\n        \"viewport\": [1200, 900],\r\n        \"outputJS\": false\r\n        }\r\n    ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\nAn example configuration could look something like this\r\n```\r\n{\r\n    \"debug\": true,\r\n    \"renderTimeout\": 120000,\r\n    \"groups\": [\r\n        {\r\n        \"enabled\": true,\r\n        \"baseDir\": \"tests/test1/\",\r\n        \"inputFile\": \"pre.html\",\r\n        \"outputFile\": \"index.html\",\r\n        \"alwaysInclude\": [\r\n            '.div-important', '#main-title a'\r\n        ],\r\n        \"viewport\": [1280, 768]\r\n        }\r\n    ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Global settings\r\n#### allowJs (boolean)\r\nIf set to true, will keep all `<script>` tags while processing the site with PhantomJS. WARNING: Allowing JS will slow the extraction process drastically.\r\n#### debug (boolean)\r\nIf set to true, will add a red border to indicate the viewport area that is being examined on the resulting HTML file. Only works on local input files.\r\n#### processExternalCss (boolean)\r\nIf set to false, will disable processing of externally linked CSS files.\r\n#### renderTimeout (int)\r\nSets the time allowed for PhantomJS to render the site and find the critical CSS styles.\r\n\r\n### Group settings\r\n#### enabled (boolean)\r\nToggles if the group should be processed by Focusr.\r\n#### baseDir (string)\r\nThe base directory to which the output (and possibly input) files are relative to.\r\n#### inputFile (string)\r\nA URL or path to a HTML file that should be processed, relative to the baseDir setting.\r\n#### outputFile (string)\r\nThe path to the output file relative to the baseDir setting. If the inputFile is a URL, this will be the output for the critical CSS file. If the input file is an local HTML file, this will output the same HTML file with inlined critical CSS and JS.\r\n#### alwaysInclude (array(string))\r\nAn array of selectors that should always be included as critical, regardless if they are in the initial viewport or not.\r\n#### httpAuth (string)\r\nA string of basic HTTP authentication, if needed for input files that are URLs. Format 'user:password'.\r\n#### wordpress (boolean)\r\nA boolean that states if the inputFile is a link to a Wordpress site that has the Focusr plugin installed.\r\n#### viewport([int, int])\r\nAn array of 2 integers that state the width and height of the viewport.\r\n#### outputJS (string)\r\nIf a path relative to the baseDir is entered here, the loadCSS Javascript will be saved to it.",
